Docker: builds the image with the name specified in ${thisdockerimage} (composum/featurelauncher-composum) from composum/featurelauncher-nodes and the maven dependencies included in target/dependencies.


## Module docker/featurelauncher
Purpose: Creates a docker image with a sling feature launcher that launches a FAR from a Sling Starter 12, but is prepared to deploy more / different features as well as packages / bundles from the filesystem.
Description: The Dockerfile in the directory creates a docker image on top of the release Sling launchpad. The module copies sling starter into the target/lib/ directory and creates two watched directories for file installation. It also provides additional utilities for diagnosing troubles from a shell within the container. 
Artifact: composum-launcher-docker-featurelauncher
Dependencies: composum-launcher-feature-nodesstarter
Docker: builds composum/featurelauncher-nodes from openjdk:17
Other Dependencies: composum-launcher-feature-integrationtest


## Module feature
Purpose: Create feature archives with classifiers oak_tar and oak_mongo from Sling starter 12 with Composum Nodes and public Composum modules.
Description: The directory contains various projects related to starting Composum with the Sling feature launcher. It includes modules such as nodesstarter and composumstarter. The feature starter modules produce archive files with classifiers oak_tar and oak_mongo. 
Artifact: composum-launcher-feature
Dependencies: None listed in the given files
Docker: No information provided about docker images.


## Module feature/sling-starter-copy

Purpose: Reduced copy of Apache Sling Starter Application
Description: A copy of the the Sling Starter demo application. It contains a copy of most of Sling Starter but cleaned
up somewhat with optional things like slingshot and htl repl. This is just for IST internal use.


## Module feature/nodesstarter
Purpose: Create Composum Feature Based Sling Starter With Composum Nodes module, a feature set, and a starter based on Sling Starter 12 snapshot to start Sling and updating Composum Nodes. It also produces a self-contained feature archive that doesn't need network access to start, and the starter contains that feature archive.
Dependencies: org.apache.sling.feature.launcher, org.apache.sling.feature.extension.content, org.apache.sling.jcr.packageinit, org.apache.felix.framework, org.apache.sling.starter, com.composum.platform.features:composum-launcher-feature-integrationtest
Docker: None specified.


# Module feature/composumstarter
Purpose: The module creates a JAR that contains the Sling Kickstarter and a feature archive containing a Sling Starter 12 and the public composum projects. This allows for the execution of this JAR to fire up a Composum instance including Pages and Assets. It also produces a self-contained feature archive that doesn't need network access to start. The starter contains that feature archive.
Description: The module uses the feature launcher to create a Sling Starter with updated Composum Nodes and deploying all public parts of composum. It relies on org.apache.sling.extension.content and org.apache.sling.jcr.packageinit for deploying the packages. It also includes integration tests and generates a .env file with the version to enable version-independent scripting files.
Artifact: composum-launcher-feature-composumstarter
Dependencies: composum-launcher-feature-nodesstarter, composum-launcher-feature-integrationtest
Docker: N/A


## Module composum-launcher-feature-felixcontainer
