## Module docker/composumnodes
Purpose: Creates a docker image from sling starter with updated Composum Core version 1 (incl. Package manager and User mgmt) and some basic scripts to fire up docker images with installed modules. The module extends slingstarter-stepwisedeploy to replace the integrated composum core v1.x version with the newest version of Composum Nodes (v2.x).
Artifact: composum-launcher-composumnodes
Dependencies: composum-launcher-slingstarter-stepwisedeploy, composum-launcher-feature-integrationtest
Docker: builds composum/nodes from composum/slingstarter-stepwisedeploy
Other:
- The docker image is built using a Dockerfile and the docker-maven-plugin in the pom.xml.
- The pom.xml uses the maven-dependency-plugin to copy the Composum Nodes bundles from the maven repository to the target/lib/ directory of the docker image.


## Module feature
Purpose: Create feature archives with classifiers oak_tar and oak_mongo from Sling starter 12 with Composum Nodes and public Composum modules.
Description: The directory contains various projects related to starting Composum with the Sling feature launcher. It includes modules such as nodesstarter and composumstarter. The feature starter modules produce archive files with classifiers oak_tar and oak_mongo. 
Artifact: composum-launcher-feature
Dependencies: None listed in the given files
Docker: No information provided about docker images.


## Module feature/sling-starter-copy

Purpose: Reduced copy of Apache Sling Starter Application
Description: A copy of the the Sling Starter demo application. It contains a copy of most of Sling Starter but cleaned
up somewhat with optional things like slingshot and htl repl. This is just for IST internal use.


## Module composum-launcher-feature-nodesstarter
Purpose: Create Composum Feature Based Sling Starter With Composum Nodes module, a feature set, and a starter based on Sling Starter 12 snapshot to start Sling and updating Composum Nodes. It also produces a self-contained feature archive that doesn't need network access to start, and the starter contains that feature archive.
Dependencies: org.apache.sling.feature.launcher, org.apache.sling.feature.extension.content, org.apache.sling.jcr.packageinit, org.apache.felix.framework, org.apache.sling.starter, com.composum.platform.features:composum-launcher-feature-integrationtest

The starter contains that feature archive.
Description: The module uses the feature launcher to create a Sling Starter with updated Composum Nodes and deploying all public parts of composum. It relies on org.apache.sling.extension.content and org.apache.sling.jcr.packageinit for deploying the packages. It also includes integration tests and generates a .env file with the version to enable version-independent scripting files.
