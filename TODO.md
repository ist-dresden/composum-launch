# Listing of TODOs wrt. composum-launcher

## Next

- Put release of starters out to maven central
  - Starters to release:
- Dockerhub deployment from Github Actions
- should composum-launcher-feature-felixcontainer be in the new starters, too?

## Backlog

- revisit all modules and evaluate whether there is an update necessary or whether they can be archived. -> Output: 
  Modules.md, extend TODO.md
- integrate dashboard!

- move Sling 11 stuff to archive, if no longer necessary. (It might be necessary for deploying stuff with package
  manager instead of features, since feature upgrades might or might not work smoothly.)

- retry startup/featurelauncher to see whether new versions help with problems
- try to convince https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-feature-launcher version 1.3.0 to work.

## Unclear

- dockerhub: composum/pages sounds like the real thing, but currently isn't. Deactivate? Repurpose?
