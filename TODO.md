# Listing of TODOs wrt. composum-launcher

- revisit all modules and evaluate whether there is an update necessary or whether they can be archived. -> Output: 
  Modules.md, extend TODO.md

- move Sling 11 stuff to archive, if no longer necessary. (It might be necessary for deploying stuff with package
  manager instead of features, since feature upgrades might or might not work smoothly.)

- retry startup/featurelauncher to see whether new versions help with problems
