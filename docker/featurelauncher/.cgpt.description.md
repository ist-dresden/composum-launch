## Module docker/featurelauncher
Purpose: Creates a docker image with a sling feature launcher that launches a FAR from a Sling Starter 12, but is prepared to deploy more / different features as well as packages / bundles from the filesystem.
Description: The Dockerfile in the directory creates a docker image on top of the release Sling launchpad. The module copies sling starter into the target/lib/ directory and creates two watched directories for file installation. It also provides additional utilities for diagnosing troubles from a shell within the container.
