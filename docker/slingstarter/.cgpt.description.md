## Module docker/slingstarter
Purpose: Creates a docker image with JDK 11 and a plain sling launchpad with debugging and JMX capability, using a maven build to copy the sling starter into target/lib/ with some preparations and scripts. This is used for testing and can be further built upon.
Description: The Dockerfile builds a docker image with the name composum/slingstarter. It also contains docker-compose files for testing. The module copies the sling starter dependencies into the target/lib directory and provides files to be installed when the docker image is started.
Artifact: composum-launcher-docker-slingstarter
Dependencies: composum-launcher-feature-integrationtest, composum-launcher-feature-felixcontainer
Docker: builds composum/slingstarter from openjdk:17.
