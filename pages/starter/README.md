# Pages Sling Starter
This is a Sling Starter (based on an older version of Sling Starter) with Composum Core V1, Platform and Pages.

It still uses Composum Core (version 1.X) and thus runs only with Platform version <1.3.0 and Pages version < 1.2.0, since these require Composum Nodes (version > 2.X) instead.

We currently do not plan to update this; the sling starter this is based on is quite old, anyway; we suggest to use the original Sling Starter https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-starter and deploy the packages, instead, or use the docker images.
