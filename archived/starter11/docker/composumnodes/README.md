This extends slingstarter-stepwisedeploy to replace the integrated composum core v1.x version with the newest version of Composum Nodes (v2.x).

Before deploying composum nodes, we need to remove the core v1 bundles first.

## Testing

Start e.g. with
./start.sh 
- this script cleans up everything after stopping.
