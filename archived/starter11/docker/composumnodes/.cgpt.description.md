## Module docker/composumnodes
Purpose: Creates a docker image from sling starter with updated Composum Core version 1 (incl. Package manager and User mgmt) and some basic scripts to fire up docker images with installed modules. The module extends slingstarter-stepwisedeploy to replace the integrated composum core v1.x version with the newest version of Composum Nodes (v2.x).
Artifact: composum-launcher-composumnodes
Dependencies: composum-launcher-slingstarter-stepwisedeploy, composum-launcher-feature-integrationtest
Docker: builds composum/nodes from composum/slingstarter-stepwisedeploy
Other:
- The docker image is built using a Dockerfile and the docker-maven-plugin in the pom.xml.
- The pom.xml uses the maven-dependency-plugin to copy the Composum Nodes bundles from the maven repository to the target/lib/ directory of the docker image.
