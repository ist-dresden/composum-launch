# Archived stuff
This directory contains stuff we keep for a while as reference and as a source of snippets
for copy and paste and adapt, but this is not maintained or even included into the build anymore and will be deleted at some point.
This is not included into the regular maven build.

Specifically, that is:

compatibilityV1: some docker images for checking compatibility of Nodes version 1.x,
which was included in (as of 4/2023) pretty old versions of Sling starter, and checking
how to update that to newer versions.

starter11: docker images etc. that use Sling Starter 11, which is from 2018.
