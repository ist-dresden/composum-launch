# Archived stuff
This directory contains stuff we keep for a while as reference and as a source of snippets
for copy and paste and adapt, but this is not maintained or even included into the build anymore and will be deleted at some point.

Specifically, that is:

compatibilityV1: some docker images for checking compatibility of Nodes version 1.x,
which was included in (as of 4/2023) pretty old versions of Sling starter, and checking
how to update that to newer versions.
