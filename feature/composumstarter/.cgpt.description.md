# Module feature/composumstarter
Purpose: The module creates a JAR that contains the Sling Kickstarter and a feature archive containing a Sling Starter 12 and the public composum projects. This allows for the execution of this JAR to fire up a Composum instance including Pages and Assets. It also produces a self-contained feature archive that doesn't need network access to start. The starter contains that feature archive.
Description: The module uses the feature launcher to create a Sling Starter with updated Composum Nodes and deploying all public parts of composum. It relies on org.apache.sling.extension.content and org.apache.sling.jcr.packageinit for deploying the packages. It also includes integration tests and generates a .env file with the version to enable version-independent scripting files.
