# Copy of Sling Starter

This directory contains a copy of most of [Sling Starter](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-starter) with changed group / artifactid, since we want to combine it's tested combination of features with our own features. Since there has been no release for a very long time and we want to rely on a stable base to create our feature archives from, we keep a copy of the Sling Starter here until version 12 is released, at which point we can probably remove this copy.
